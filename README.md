# Project Title

## Overview

This project implements a model for generating embeddings from documents using the `SentenceTransformer` library and creates a FAISS index for efficient similarity search. The codebase is designed to facilitate the integration of natural language processing (NLP) tasks with efficient vector search capabilities.

## Features

- Generate embeddings for a list of documents using a pre-trained SentenceTransformer model.
- Create a FAISS index for fast nearest neighbor search on the generated embeddings.
- Support for batch processing of documents to optimize performance.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Generating Embeddings

To generate embeddings from a list of documents, use the `generate_embeddings` function:
